# Installing Kubernetes the kubeadm way on Apple Silicon

In here is the setup specific to newer Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs. VirtualBox currently does not have good support for these Macs, therefore we will create the Ubuntu virtual machines using Multipass.

Multipass should also work on older Macs (Core i7/Core i9 x86), as should [VirtualBox](../virtualbox/).
